RAW DATA FOUND IN data/

=====================

How to run these benchmarks:

First, some prerequisites are:

* make
* gcc and recent g++

Now, run:

$ make
$ python bench.py

Modify bench.py to test different operations...(separated due to excessive testing times per operation)

To generate a graph:
* You first have to modify graph.plot to plot the data you want (if you can figure out the csv output from python)
* Then run:
$ make graph
